Fork your course
## What is it?
Forkshop is a web app for designing and forking educational workshops.  Currently in super duper alpha, which means we may break this into pieces at any time.  Best wait til we make some progress to use.

## Usage
You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [mongodb](http://mongodb.org) to run this application.  Installing these is out-of-scope, and instructions are contained on the links to the left.

1. Clone the project (you can download the zip above or use git)
2. In the project's folder, run `npm install`.  Wait for it to install all necessary components.
3. Run `node app.js`.  

You'll now, by default, have a web application running at http://localhost:9200 -- you can edit the port by changing config.js.
